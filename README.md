Read the projects prerequisites, RTFM, read the documentation, books AND try all the examples of the docs. Make sure you understand all of the required concepts and algorithms before you go do your daily tasks.

Sometimes, you will be able to guess solutions or complete tasks without totally understanding all the concepts, especially at the beginning of the program or at the beginning of a new track when the tasks are very small: this is wrong. Getting good scores is less important than understanding and being able to explain things. Always remember one thing: your goal is not to become great students, your goal is to become great software engineers, and no one wants to hire students.

NEVER copy and paste anything.
Do NOT rush to computers, use documentation, pen & papers, whiteboards. DO NOT look at Google/Internet yet. Dont write any piece of code before you have the solution. Coding should only be translating your solution to computer code.

First, rephrase the problem. What are you trying to accomplish here? Then go through different examples: if I understand correctly, then with this input/context/parameters I should output/print/return/draw/ this. What could be the edge cases you have to think about to make sure your function/program will always work correctly and never crash?

Then focus first on the basic/regular use cases. What should be my algorithm? When you found it, try to "run it through different examples and see if the input/output match your expectations. Once you get that, try to see what changes you have to make to take care of all possible edge cases.

While thinking about your algorithm, try to break things down: a big problem is easier to solve when you break it into smaller, easier problems.

Once you have found your algorithm or solution, only then, you can sit in front of your computer and code.

Cant find the solution? Think more, its out there. Read the documentation again.
You found (or you think you found) a/the solution, try it. If it does not work, then go back to your code and try to find out why it doesnt work (or why it does work) without looking at the error message.

IMPORTANT It is very important to always understand what you are coding but also why we are focusing on some of the things we are focusing on at Holberton. Understanding the big picture is very important, never blindly work on tasks without first understanding why it is important to spend time on the topic of the day and how it plays a role in the system or comprehension of CS.

One example is the bit manipulation project. Why do you think this is important? And is it really? In the next project you will see concrete application (dealing with different open flags) but during the project, did you ask yourself why?. Why binary? Where do bits play a role? How is it connected to the machine, memory, bytes and values of types?

If you havent asked and answered those questions, then you did it wrong.

And if someone comes to you with this question and you dont have the answer. Stop everything and work on answering this question right away. Even if this was a past project for you. Understanding why will help you understand the big picture as well as finding more meanings in bits and build up your motivation.

AAW: Always. Ask. Why.
Still cant find why it doesnt work? Most of the time, the answer is in the error message.
If you still cant find the solution or why your code doesnt work, google it (error message, specific question, specific problem, etc). NEVER copy and paste something from the Internet. You need to understand everything before you go back to your code and implement something you did read.

NEVER TRUST THE INTERNET: Always make sure what you are reading does make sense and is correct. Test every assumption. A lot of the content on the Internet is wrong or incomplete.

Important note: you should only google something specific. This step is NOT about looking at how to do the project. It should only help answer a specific question you are having trouble with or looking for a specific error message.

Important note: This also means that you are not allowed to look at the solution / other peoples code. Even for analysis. Looking at other peoples code / solution is considered cheating. You need to find the solution by yourself (or with the help of someone else, see 7., 8. and 9.).
If you cant find it, then Google again. Try using more context in your search. Try rephrasing your question.
If you are stuck with a problem, dont wait too long before asking to a peer. It is part of your job to ask for help. You are expected to do so, just like you will be expected to do so when you will have a job. There are no stupid question!

7.0 If you ask for help

Respect the time of others. Make sure you spent enough time going through previous steps.

7.1 If you are asked for help

Respect every question. There is nothing more unmotivated than having someone laughing at your question or replying what? you still dont know that?
Do NOT touch others computers / keyboards. Explain, and let the person who ask for help type and correct their bugs/code.
Do not give the final answer. You are here to guide, help them find the solution by themselves:
Always start with making sure that the person who is asking for help went through the previous steps including reading the documentation we provided. If you help someone without making sure of this, you are NOT helping them AT ALL
The student should explain what is the problem and what they tried
Give hints
Try rephrasing the question: So what you are really looking for is
Point to the right documentation: You should read the manual of this command
When explaining something, always start with whiteboarding the algorithm. Again, coding should come at the end, only to translate the solution to code. When the student understand the solution, then clean the whiteboard, and ask the student to do it again on their own. Repeat until the student can do it.
Its ok to code it in front of the student and explain the code. But then delete the file and ask the student to do it again on their own. Repeat until the student can do it.
Sometimes, you wont be able to help because you will not find the problem or the solution to the specific problem / bug you are presented. In this case, you are responsible to find someone who can. Stay with the person until its done: you will also learn how to solve the problem! There will be time where you will end up working as a group of 5+ students on the issue, and thats ok.

At Holberton, its your job to ask and its your job to help.

8. Ask more peers
If someone doesnt have the answer or doesnt have the time right now, ask someone else. 99% of the time, someone knows and has the answer. Ask several students, from your cohort first, and then from previous cohorts. Also, different students will have different ways of explaining.

Again, once you understand something on the whiteboard, clean it and do it again on your own. You actually understand something only when you are able to do it on your own.
Each cohort has its dedicated Teacher Assistant. TAs are students from previous cohorts, who performed very well and who are good at explaining concepts. They are here (physically or on Slack) to help. Remember: go through the previous 9 steps before asking a TA. The first thing that a TA will ask you is: what did you do, what is the error message, where is your whiteboard work, did you ask your peers, .
If your TA is not onsite/busy, or not answering on Slack (or cant find the solution), you can also ask TAs from other cohorts including TAs from previous cohorts.
If no-one was able to help, ask someone on staff. We are here to help! We are on Slack and on site! If staff cannot help, flesh out your general concerns into specific and actionable questions (that you also tried Googling another time, but couldnt find a satisfactory answer to). Once you have your list, ask staff for a mentor recommendation or do your own research about the mentors we have in our own network who you think would be qualified to answer your questions. Ask those mentors for answers/advice to your specific and actionable questions.
